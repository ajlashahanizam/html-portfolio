    <h5>Semanis Cinta di Cappadocia</h5>
    <p>Highly recommended malay movie. The scenery, story plot, everything regarding this movie captivates me.</p>
    <h5>The Chronicles of Narnia</h5>
    <p>This is my go to all time favourite series, especially when I needed an escape from all the hectic and pressure of work loads. Definitely worked for me ! Highly recommended for family movie night too. Thanks me Later !</p>
    <h5>The Twillight Series</h5>
    <p>Actually, I debated hard to choose between this and the Harry Potter series. It is more of a teenager memories I guess, hence the selection. Also, I love how calming and serene this movie is plus the soundtrack really moved you to bits !</p>
